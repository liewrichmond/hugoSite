I'm a graduate from Northeastern University's class of 2020 (talk about luck amirite?) in Computer Engineering. My interests involve everything related to computers from Web Dev to Computer Architecture. I currently code up projects in anything I'm interested in, in whatever programming language is suitable. As of right now, I don't make any money off of coding. If you'd like to help me change that and exchange money for code, feel free to hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richmond-liew/) or my [email](mailto:richmond.liew.97@gmail.com)!
